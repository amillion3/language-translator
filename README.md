# Language Translator

## Description
This app has a simple purpose, to translate a couple holiday phrases into other languages. This app was planned as a team, but coded individually.
1. Uses a constructor function to generate language dictionaries.
2. Adds event listeners on all the buttons.
3. Gathers user input for translations, converts to lowercase, and removes non-letter characters.
4. Uses for...in loops to compare user input to the language dictionaries.
5. Writes translation to DOM below the buttons.

## Technology
